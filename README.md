# revit-wpf-template
Template visual studio for creating Revit C# .net addin with WPF


This is my first template wpf for creating Revit Addin. I'm learning the first solution with my friend to understand:

- Using WPF for revit api
- Data binding
- Using external event for the button and the modeless diaglog


I am learning the pattern MVVM and I will changing this template soon.
