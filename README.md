# Revit WPF Template
Template in visual studio for creating Revit C# .net addin with WPF

WPF in Revit API maybe make some difficulties for the first times to work with it.
As a beginner and a selt-touch developper, I waste many times to understand how does it works.
So, I create this template to using in my future other projects.
I hope my solution will help you.
Thank thebuildingcoder and HOKGroup for giving me to this solution.

In this template, I show how I use:
  - MVVM pattern
  - External Event of Revit API with modeless form WPF
  - Binding command, not use directely event of WPF
  - Fix some problem with modeless forme: topmost, Window owner, minimize Window
  - Integrate type Window, Usercontrol in this template
